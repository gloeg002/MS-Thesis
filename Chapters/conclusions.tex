 \section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When using ideal, top-hat, wind stress the largest amount of inertial energy is put into
	the model when the duration of the forcing is half an inertial periods.
	
	\item Ideal forcing is good putting energy inertial energy in the system but puts little energy
	in at wind forced frequencies. 
	
	\item In order to accurately model inertial events the initial phase needs to be properly assessed.
	
	\item \RED{Coherence between sites?}
\end{itemize}
