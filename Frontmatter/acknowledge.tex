Many people have earned my gratitude while completing this thesis. First and foremost I need to thank my
advisor Dr. Jay Austin for putting up with me for the past two years. His patience, guidance, and suggestions greatly improved my final thesis. 
The faculty and staff of the large lakes observatory for providing work space. The wonderful crew of R.V Blue Heron for all their hard work collecting this data. Matt James for
helping to set up the model during its infancy. Minnesota Supercomputing Institute for all the work they do providing high computing power to researchers
at the University of Minnesota campuses. My fiends and family for their love and support. Lastly NSF for providing the funds to complete this body of work.
